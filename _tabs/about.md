# About Me

Currently studying for my LFCS, but also really enjoy coding/scripting/automation with Bash, VBA, Python, Gawk & Ansible. I would classify myself a _"Jack of most, Master of none"_ type of person when it comes to all this, but i have been putting a lot of focus into Linux, and hence the LFCS.

I have been home labbing since 2014, starting out with my very first Ubuntu 14.04 server. I started off running a snapraid(samba)/plex/vpn/mail(gmail) server, running on an old (now running Arch) i7 3770k, asus p8z77-v lx motherboard and 16GB of RAM. I did have an old OVH Linux VPS, but was mostly used for testing my linux skills on. I would also run my own satellite tuner PCI card and run my own TV server. I've owned every raspberry pi that has been released, but the fun stuff started happening with the raspberry pi 2, where i set up my own music server/internet radio using kodi (or XBMC (or openelec if i remember right)from back in the day), which also hosted it's own pi hat amp, and speakers.

A lot has happened since then, so i feel the time is right to document/blog all these cool projects I get myself involved in. 

See you in the next blog post. :)
