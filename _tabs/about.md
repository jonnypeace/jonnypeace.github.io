# Short History of When it all Started

Recently completing my LFCS certification, I also really enjoy coding/scripting/automation with Bash, VBA, Python, Gawk & Ansible. I would classify myself a _"Jack of most, Master of none"_ type of person, but I have been specialising my skills in Linux, and hence the LFCS.

I have been home labbing since 2014, starting out with my very first Ubuntu 14.04 server. I started off running a snapraid(samba)/plex/vpn/mail(gmail) server, running on an old (now running Arch) i7 3770k, asus p8z77-v lx motherboard and 16GB g-skill tridentX 2400mhz (fast for ddr3) of RAM. I did have an old OVH Linux VPS, but was mostly used for testing my linux skills on. I would also run my own satellite tuner PCI card and run my own TV server. I've owned every raspberry pi that has been released, but the fun Pi stuff started happening with the raspberry pi 2, where i set up my own music server/internet radio using kodi (or XBMC (or openelec if i remember right)from back in the day), which also hosted it's own pi hat amp, and speakers.

A lot has happened since then, so i feel the time is right to document/blog all these cool projects I get myself involved in. 

See you in the next blog post. :)
