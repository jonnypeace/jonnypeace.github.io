# The Concept
* There are two scripts. One for backup, another for restore.
* The backup script holds onto 2 weeks worth of incremental backups
* This backup solution uses tar and gz compression.
* Once you've ensured that you are backing up all relevant files/directories, run on a crontab at a time which suits you.
* If you have made an error during testing, it is best to remove all the files (including the file.inc) and start over.
* Be sure to change the directories according to the directories which require backup, and where the backups will be located.

## The backup script

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# incremental backup directory
dirbk=/EDIT/ME/I/AM/YOUR/BACKUP/DIRECTORY

# directory to be backed up
dirfrom=/home/user

# incremental file which keeps track of changing
incfile=file.inc

# name of the file for back up, no extensions required here, just one word, avoid spaces.
backfile=home

# date for directory and .tgz file naming
day=$(date +'%F')

#Check number of directories with week-ending, and count them
dirnum=$(find "$dirbk"/*week-ending* -type d 2> /dev/null | wc -l)

# My aim is to keep two weeks of backups at all times.
# If you want to adjust this, adjust the number 3 accordingly.
# Example: 3 will keep 2 full weeks of dailing backups.
if [[ "$dirnum" -ge 3 ]]; then
	dir1=$(find "$dirbk"/*week-ending* -type d 2> /dev/null | sort | awk 'NR==1{print}')
	rm -r "$dir1";
fi

# Counting the number .tgz files
filenum=$(find "$dirbk"/*.tgz -type f 2> /dev/null | wc -l)

# Once 7 .tgz are created, move them to a new week-ending directory
# If run daily on cron job, this will be a weeks worth of incremental backups
if [[ "$filenum" -ge 7 ]]; then
	mkdir -p "$dirbk"/week-ending-"$day"
	mv "$dirbk"/*.tgz "$dirbk"/week-ending-"$day"
	mv "$dirbk"/"$incfile" "$dirbk"/week-ending-"$day"
fi

# Create .tgz file. Ideally this will work in a cron job, and you'll get daily backups
# to exclude a directory after the tar command, example --exclude='/home/user/folder'
tar -vcz -g "$dirbk"/"$incfile" -f "$dirbk"/"$backfile"-"$day".tgz "$dirfrom"

```

## The recovery script

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# incremental backup directory where your backup tar files are kept
dirbk=/backup/directory

# Directory to recover incremental backups to
recdir="$HOME"/recovered

mkdir -p "$recdir"

cd "$recdir" || exit

for f in "$dirbk"/*.tgz ; do
	tar -x -g /dev/null -f "$f"
done
```
