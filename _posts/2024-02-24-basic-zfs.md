# ZFS Configuration and Management Guide


This document outlines essential steps and considerations for configuring and managing ZFS storage pools, including creating a mirrored pool, setting properties, monitoring, and utilizing snapshots for data protection.

## Creating a ZFS Pool
To create a mirrored ZFS pool named `new-pool` with two disks (`/dev/sdb` and `/dev/sdc`), use the following command:

```bash
sudo zpool create new-pool mirror /dev/sdb /dev/sdc
```

## Creating ZFS Filesystems
Create a ZFS filesystem within your pool for organized data management:

```bash
sudo zfs create new-pool/myfilesystem
```

## Setting ZFS Properties
ZFS supports various properties for optimizing storage. Examples include:

- **Compression**
To save space, you can enable compression on your pool or on individual filesystems within the pool.

  ```bash
  sudo zfs set compression=on new-pool
  ```

- **Deduplication**
If you expect to store a lot of duplicate data, enabling deduplication can save space, but be cautious as it can be very memory intensive.
  ```bash
  sudo zfs set dedup=on new-pool
  ```

## Snapshots
Utilize snapshots for data protection and point-in-time recovery:

```bash
sudo zfs snapshot new-pool/myfilesystem@mySnapshot
```

## Monitoring Pool Health
Regularly check your ZFS pool's health:

```bash
sudo zpool status new-pool
```

## Autmating Scrubs
Scheduling regular scrubs of the pool can help detect and correct any data integrity issues. Scrubs can be scheduled using cron jobs

```bash
# Example cron job to scrub on the first day of every month at midnight
0 0 1 * * /usr/sbin/zpool scrub new-pool
```

## Automating Snapshots with zfs-auto-snapshot
Install `zfs-auto-snapshot` for automatic snapshot management:

```bash
sudo apt-get install zfs-auto-snapshot
```

After installation, it automatically schedules snapshots and manages their retention.

## Customizing Snapshot Policies
Edit cron jobs in `/etc/cron.d` to customize snapshot frequencies and retention policies.

## Manual Snapshot Creation
Create and manage snapshots manually:

```bash
sudo zfs-auto-snapshot --keep=7 daily
```

## Excluding Filesystems from Snapshots
Exclude specific filesystems from automatic snapshots:

```bash
sudo zfs set com.sun:auto-snapshot=false new-pool/myfilesystem
```

## Recovering from a Drive Failure

When a drive fails in a ZFS pool, it's crucial to replace it as soon as possible to maintain data redundancy and pool health. Here's a step-by-step guide to recover from a drive failure:

1. **Identify the Failed Drive**

   Use `zpool status` to identify the failed drive in your pool:

   ```bash
   sudo zpool status new-pool
   ```

2. **Offline the Failed Drive**

   If the drive is still online but faulty, offline it manually:

   ```bash
   sudo zpool offline new-pool /dev/sdx
   ```

   Replace `/dev/sdx` with the actual device identifier of the failed drive.

3. **Replace the Drive**

   Physically replace the failed drive with a new one. Ensure the new drive is of equal or greater capacity.

4. **Add the New Drive to the Pool**

   Use the `zpool replace` command to replace the failed drive with the new one in your pool:

   ```bash
   sudo zpool replace new-pool /dev/sdx /dev/sdy
   ```

   Replace `/dev/sdx` with the failed drive and `/dev/sdy` with the new drive.

5. **Monitor Resilvering Process**

   ZFS will begin the resilvering process to restore data redundancy. Monitor the progress with:

   ```bash
   sudo zpool status new-pool
   ```

6. **Verify Pool Health**

   Once resilvering is complete, verify the pool's health:

   ```bash
   sudo zpool status new-pool
   ```

   Ensure the pool status is `ONLINE` and there are no remaining errors.

## Setting Up RAID-Z (Equivalent to RAID 5)

RAID-Z is ZFS's equivalent to RAID 5, offering a balance between storage capacity, fault tolerance, and performance. Here's how to set up a RAID-Z pool:

1. **Creating a RAID-Z Pool**

   To create a RAID-Z pool, you need at least three disks. Here's the command to create a RAID-Z pool named `raidz-pool` with three disks:

   ```bash
   sudo zpool create raidz-pool raidz /dev/sda /dev/sdb /dev/sdc
   ```

   Replace `/dev/sda`, `/dev/sdb`, and `/dev/sdc` with your actual disk identifiers.

2. **Checking Pool Status**

   After creation, check the status of your pool to ensure it's online and no errors are reported:

   ```bash
   sudo zpool status raidz-pool
   ```

3. **Expanding a RAID-Z Pool**

   Expanding a RAID-Z pool can be done by adding another set of disks in a RAID-Z configuration. For example, to add another three disks to the pool:

   ```bash
   sudo zpool add raidz-pool raidz /dev/sdd /dev/sde /dev/sdf
   ```

   Note: ZFS does not support expanding an existing RAID-Z by adding a single disk to the vdev. Expansion typically involves adding a new vdev of the same type to the pool.

4. **Monitoring and Managing the Pool**

   Use `zpool status`, `zfs list`, and other ZFS commands to monitor and manage your RAID-Z pool.

## Summary

1. Creating a ZFS Pool: The guide starts with instructions on creating a mirrored ZFS pool using zpool create, demonstrating how to mirror two devices for redundancy.

2. Setting Pool Properties: It explains how to adjust ZFS pool properties, such as setting the auto-snapshot feature using zfs set to automatically manage snapshots for backup and recovery purposes.

3. Snapshot Management: The guide covers creating, listing, and rolling back snapshots, providing a foundation for efficient data management and recovery strategies.

4. ZFS Auto-Snapshot: It introduces the zfs-auto-snapshot feature, which automates the snapshot process, and briefly touches on its configuration options for tailoring snapshot frequency and retention.

5. Recovering from a Drive Failure: This section details the steps to identify and replace a failed drive in a ZFS pool, including offlining the failed drive, physically replacing it, and the subsequent resilvering process to restore data redundancy.
