# The why?

This is a shell script that I do use quite frequently, since it's been run in a cron job to check for host lookup ip changes (utilizing dynamic DNS).
This saves users from being locked out if their home ip address changes, also helps keep a strong firewall.

This basic example will allow two people to access SSH and HTTPS ports.. This works so long as those two people are allowed access on those ports, so this script would probably need modified to accomodate, or just use seperate scripts for groups of individuals.

The main section of this script to adjust are the two arrays, one for ports and the other is clients, at the top of the script. If you want to add more, just follow the same format with ports and clients

If using hosts.deny, this script will accomdate a hosts.allow, but obviously this could be modified also. If you want to use this TCP wrapper, put a 'sshd: ALL' or something along those lines which suits your needs in your hosts.deny.


```bash
#!/bin/bash
#allow a dyndns name through your firewall. The idea is to set up a crontab
#to look up the dns hostname so you always have access to the server, via
#your port and protocol of choice. I use something like this to keep a VPN
#tunnel open to a server.

#for manual entry, syntax in terminal for UFW....
#./script.sh ip port proto, i.e.
#./script.sh 123.12.123.12 22 tcp

declare -A ports
# Update ports to cycle through your firewall
ports[ssh]=12345
ports[https]=443

declare -A clients
# Check hosts accodiated with client
clients[jamie]=$(host homeIPaddress1.ddns.net | cut -f4 -d' ')
clients[holly]=$(host homeIPaddress2.ddns.net | cut -f4 -d' ')
#clients[]=
