# The why?

This is a shell script that I do use quite frequently, since it's been run in a cron job to check for host lookup ip changes (utilizing dynamic DNS).
This saves users from being locked out if their home ip address changes, also helps keep a stronger firewall.

This basic example will allow two people to access SSH and HTTPS ports.. This works so long as those two people are allowed access on those ports, so this script would probably need modified to accomodate, or just use seperate scripts for groups of individuals.

The only section of this script to adjust are the two arrays, one for ports and the other is clients, at the top of the script. If you want to add more, just follow the same format with ports and clients. Comment out or delete sections with nginx or hosts.allow if not required.

If using hosts.deny, this script will accomdate a hosts.allow, but obviously this could be modified also. If you want to use this TCP wrapper, put a 'sshd: ALL' or something along those lines which suits your needs in your hosts.deny.

If using the nginx side, place this key in the server block of your nginx config. #SED-MATCH-LEAVE
I could have used a substitute option for sed up to a point, but at least with this method, it will help with the set up of a newly created config or new user.
Also if using the nginx config like me, and you don't need the world wide web on your server, place a _deny all;_ in the server block underneath the allowed ip's.


```bash
#!/bin/bash
#allow a dyndns name through your firewall. The idea is to set up a crontab
#to look up the dns hostname so you always have access to the server, via
#your port and protocol of choice. I use something like this to keep a VPN
#tunnel open to a server.

#for manual entry, syntax in terminal for UFW....
#./script.sh ip port proto, i.e.
#./script.sh 123.12.123.12 22 tcp
